                    <p>Sealing is an ordinance performed in Latter Day Saint temples by a person holding the 
                         sealing authority. The purpose of this ordinance is to seal familial relationships, making 
                         possible the existence of family relationships throughout eternity. LDS teachings place great
                         importance on the specific authority required to perform these sealings. . </p>
                    
                    <p>A most important point to underline is that if you are considering marriage in a certain
                         temple, you
                         should definitely
                         write or contact in person the president of that temple and request the necessary information.
